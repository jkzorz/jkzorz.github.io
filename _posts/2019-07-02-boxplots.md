Boxplots are a relatively simple way to show numerical data, while providing the viewer key infomration about the range, median, and distribution of the data. I'm going to be creating boxplots to visualize the distributions of species that are statistically differentially abundant between groups. The statistics to determine the differentially abundant species was done using <b>indicator species analysis</b> which was explained in <b>[this tutorial](https://jkzorz.github.io/2019/07/02/Indicator-species-analysis.html)</b>.

First, we load in the data as before: 

```
pc = read.csv("Your_OTU_table.csv", header= TRUE)
```

This table has the format of rows as samples and columns as OTUs/species.

Next, we subset the data as desired by calling the specific columns we want to include in our boxplot figure. I've chosen the top four most significant OTUs associated with the "Late" grouping, identified using the [indicator species analysis test](https://jkzorz.github.io/2019/07/02/Indicator-species-analysis.html).

```
sub_pc = data.frame(Time = pc$Time, OTU15 = pc$OTU15, OTU11 = pc$OTU11, OTU26 = pc$OTU26, OTU6 = pc$OTU6) 
```

Next, we load in the ggplot2 and reshape2 packages (for plotting and data manipulation respectively): 

 ```
 library(ggplot2)
 library(reshape2)
 ```

Next, we convert the data frame from a "wide" format to a "long" format [(See here for example of wide vs long data)](https://jkzorz.github.io/2019/06/05/stacked-bar-plots.html): 

```
sub_pc_m = melt(sub_pc, id = "Time")
```

Now we can plot the data using <b>geom_boxplot</b> from ggplot2: 

```
gg = ggplot(sub_pc_m, aes(x = variable, y = value, fill = Time)) + 
     geom_boxplot(colour = "black", position = position_dodge(0.5)) +
     geom_vline(xintercept = c(1.5,2.5,3.5), colour = "grey85", size = 1.2) +
     theme(legend.title = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"), 
     legend.text = element_text(size = 10, face = "bold"), legend.position = "right", 
     axis.text.x = element_text(face = "bold",colour = "black", size = 12), 
     axis.text.y = element_text(face = "bold", size = 12, colour = "black"), 
     axis.title.y = element_text(face = "bold", size = 14, colour = "black"), 
     panel.background = element_blank(), panel.border = element_rect(fill = NA, colour = "black"), 
     legend.key=element_blank()) + 
     labs(x= "", y = "Relative Abundance (%)", fill = "Time") + 
     scale_fill_manual(values = c("steelblue2", "steelblue4"))
     
gg
```


Save using: 
```
ggsave("Boxplot.svg")
```

This figure shows 8 boxplots, 2 boxplots for each OTU. The boxplots in the light blue colour display the distribution of the abundance data for the corresponding OTU in the "Early" grouping, whereas the boxplots in the dark colour display the distribution of the abundance data for the corresponding OTU in the "Late" grouping. 

<b>The boxplot has a few main parts: </b>
<ul>
 <li> The coloured box shows the median in the middle, and is bounded by the first and third quartiles (i.e. the 25th and 75th percentiles). The box makes up the area referred to as the <b>Interquartile range or IQR</b> </li>
 <li> The lines (or "whiskers") extending from the box represent the range of the data. Specifically, the upper line shows the maximum point that is no further than 1.5*IQR above the box's Q1, and the lower line shows the minimum point that is no further than 1.5*IQR below the box's Q3 </li>
 <li>Any data not included within the range defined by the box and "whiskers" (i.e. plus/minus 1.5*IQR) is plotted as a dot, and is referred to as an "outlier". There are no outliers present in this figure </li>
 </ul>
