It can be daunting to know where to start with your data analysis once you've received your likely huge amplicon sequencing dataset. Below I've divided the tutorials into categories based on what you may be looking to accomplish: 


<h3>Data Visualization</h3>
<ul>
<li> <b>[Stacked bar plots](https://jkzorz.github.io/2019/06/05/stacked-bar-plots.html)</b>: For displaying compositional data (i.e. relative abundance of species) of discrete samples </li>
<li> <b>[Bubble plots](https://jkzorz.github.io/2019/06/05/Bubble-plots.html)</b>: For displaying compositional data (i.e. relative abundance of species) of discrete samples </li>
<li> <b>[Box plots](https://jkzorz.github.io/2019/07/02/boxplots.html)</b>: For displaying information on the distribution of continuous data (i.e. relative abundance, diversity) across a dataset (or dataset subset) for a specific set of species or samples </li>

<h3>Statistical Testing</h3>
