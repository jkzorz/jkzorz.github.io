It can be daunting to know where to start with your data analysis once you've received your (likely huge) amplicon sequencing dataset. Below I've divided the R tutorials into categories based on what you may be looking to accomplish: 


<h3>Data Visualization</h3>

  -**[Stacked bar plots](https://jkzorz.github.io/2019/06/05/stacked-bar-plots.html)**: For displaying compositional data (i.e. relative abundance of species) of discrete samples 
  
  -**[Bubble plots](https://jkzorz.github.io/2019/06/05/Bubble-plots.html)**: For displaying compositional data (i.e. relative abundance of species) of discrete samples
  
  -**[Box plots](https://jkzorz.github.io/2019/07/02/boxplots.html)**: For displaying information on the distribution of continuous data (i.e. relative abundance, diversity) across a dataset (or dataset subset) for a specific set of species or samples




<h3>Statistical Testing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>ANOSIM test: </li>
  <li>Indicator Species test: </li>
  <li>NMDS plot: </li>
  </ul>
