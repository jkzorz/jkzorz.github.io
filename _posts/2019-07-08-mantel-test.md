Statistics can be a scary word, especially, if you're like me and it's been a long time since you've had anything to do with probability or math. For the most part, I don't think it's necessary to understand all the equations behind the statistics that you do, but I do think it's important to know that you're using the right test for your data, and that you're not making any assumptions about your data that aren't supported.  Again, I find that the [GUSTAME](https://sites.google.com/site/mb3gustame/) website is a fantastic resource for learning about the basics of whatever test you decide to do.  


Mantel tests are correlation tests that determine the correlation between two matrices.
