Error bars show the range of variability associated with a value. This variability can be representative of natural variations, uncertainty, or error, and can be caluculated from a number of measures for variation including standard deviation, standard error, range, and confidence intervals. Incorporating error bars into plots in R is actually not as straightforward as you might expect coming from excel or the like, so I've decided to provide this tutorial based on my trials and tribulations with this process. 

There are two ways to start with this
