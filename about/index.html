	<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Jackie and I started working with R and microbial ecology data during my Master's degree, where I was working with hundreds of marine 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing samples. I've compiled some of the code that I've worked with over the years into these <a href="https://jkzorz.github.io/blog/"> tutorials</a>. Hopefully you find them helpful!
