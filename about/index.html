	<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Jackie and I am a PhD student working in the <a href="https://www.ucalgary.ca/labs/ebg">Energy Bioengineering and Geomicrobiology group at the University of Calgary</a>. I started working with R and microbial ecology data during my Master's degree, when I was trying to figure out how to handle data sets with thousands of species and hundreds of samples from an extensive marine 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing survey. I've compiled some of the code that I've worked with over the years into these <a href="https://jkzorz.github.io/blog/"> tutorials</a>. Hopefully you find them helpful!
