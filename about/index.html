	<h1>About Me</h1>

My name is Jackie and I am a PhD Student working in the <a href="https://www.ucalgary.ca/ebg/">Energy Bioengineering and Geomicrobiology Group</a> at the University of Calgary.  I started working with R and microbial ecology data during my Master's degree, where I was working with hundreds of marine 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing samples. I've compiled some of the code that I've worked with over the years into these <a href="https://jkzorz.github.io/blog/"> tutorials</a>. Hopefully you find them helpful!
