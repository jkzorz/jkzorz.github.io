	<h1>Analyzing Microbial Ecology Data</h1>
	<p>A place for me to keep track of code I've used to generate R visualizations, and statistical analyses, specifically for the purpose of visualizing and analyzing large microbial ecology datasets. 
		
<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> I am in no way an R expert, I wouldn't even really consider myself to be at the amateur level. Everything I use has basically worked for me once, and so I keep adapting it over time as needed. There are probably hundreds of better/different ways to do things in R than what I do, but all the code I'm sharing has worked for me and is what I've become relatively comfortable with.
	
I'm also not a stats expert by any means. I rely a lot on some really great resources out there. <b>My go to is <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mb3gustame/>GUSTAME</a></b>, which is a guide to statistical analysis in microbial ecology. Also their papers: 
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2121141">Multivariate analyses in microbial ecology</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsec/article/90/3/543/536864">A guide to statistical analysis in microbial ecology: a community-focused, living review of multivariate data analyses</a></li>
	</ul>
